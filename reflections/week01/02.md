## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit? - Specificity determines which rule should be applied to a targeted element, when that element is being targeted by multiple rules with different values. You might use it to change the color of one <div> box to lavender, when all <div> boxes are assigned to yellow by another rule's default.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature? It kind of ruins the point of having specificity. It would make other rules null used on elements with !important. You can't quickly change it along with other targeted elements, so having a lot of them would make manually editing each one challenging, and you could not quickly batch fix a lot of changes.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment: I learned so much about flexboxes today, and how to align features on a webpage through css and html.

notes: we adhere to the S in the SOLID principles - Single Responsibility. Our index.html is responsible for content and our style.css is responsible for how that content is presented. Our code is now easier to read and maintain resulting in quicker debugging and less bugs overall.
