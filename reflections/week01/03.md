## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design? Make the most important part of the webpage (such as the button "buy") stand out the most. Middle ones somewhat inbetween; maybe put a border on just the left. For buttons that aren't the primary objective of the site, such as "contact us" or "returns" you can make the button not stand out, and dim the font so it's readable, but doesn't stand out to the eye. 
Picking 2-3 primary colors for a site keeps it uniform, pleasant, and professional.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas. -
1. https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_templates.asp
2. https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone? You can convey what is the primary purpose for visiting/using the website. You can influence or direct people to interact and use the website how you desire; for example, on a store platform you can emphasize the "buy" or "purchase" buttons, the cart ect while downplaying the buttons you don't want people to interact with unless they have to, such as the "remove from basket", or "start a return". Good design has SO much influence. It's like directing them to the goal, versus the benches.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment: I understand looking at a website (or thing I'm building) to think of containers as the big picture: your header, body, footer. Maybe the entire container holding the website. Containers hold rows.
Rows are smaller boxes, for example on CodeWorks' website: the title row, the logo row, the row with site navigation links, the video or text content rows, the bottom row of links, the row with cart, the bottom row with final links and copyright information.
