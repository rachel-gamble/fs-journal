## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? It's a first blueprint to generate ideas, while also sharing a client to get approval and ideas before moving on to the actual coding.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful? 

low fidelity - least detailed. quick and easy, can be drawn in person. no distractions from style. useful because it can be drawn up quickly on paper or white board with client ect in person.

medium fidelity - a bit more detailed and accurate layout. avoids distractions still, features are distinguishable from eachother, text weights to separate headers and body content. use of grey scale to communicate visual prominence of elements. Most common wireframe. usually digital. useful to get a more detailed idea without being distracted by styling.

high-fidelity - may have actual featured images and written text content. Useful for exploring complex concepts like menu systems or interactive maps. Usually saved for later stages.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes I do, totally! I think that for the designer, sketching out the idea takes a lot of the guess work out and helps organize everything before getting lost in the code. It also allowed the client to give tips, and for the designer to make changes to a visual representation quickly, rather than having to sort in the trenches of committed code to change every small or huge shift needing to be made.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment: I don't understand icons. lol {future me does kind of now? I wasn't adding the mdi cdn link into the HTML head before so they weren't working} I hand drew my first wire-frame, and I really enjoyed it. It gave me a much greater idea of how everything layed out. And personally, I enjoyed working with paper and pen rather than MORE computer stuff. I'm sure eventually I'll switch to figma, but maybe I'll always enjoy doing a big of work. I get why wire-frames are important, they're like, uber important. Otherwise you're just wilding out with no framework for the site you're building.
