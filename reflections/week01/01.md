## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git? It's an easy way to control versions and organize.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches? Using, for an example, a master and test branch - one can practices changes out on one branch (test) without affecting the work on the master branch. This allows for more modification on both ends, and the favored on can be merged. Or, changes made on a remote repository can be added/merged with the local repository, and vice versa.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a software that helps us keep our programs at the right version we need for the project, and organizes in the local repository. GitHub on the other hand is a remote repository.
