## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

Await is used to wait for a promise and get its fulfillment value.

Await usually needs to be within an async function.

Async functions return a promise.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

You have to put 'await' inside of an async function. It will sort of pause the code until the promise is rejected or resolved.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

Your code looks much simpler to read! Multiple async functions can be chained, and again, easier to read. Easier debugging.
