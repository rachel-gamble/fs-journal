## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

The three states are:
pending - promise started, not finished
fulfilled - promised completed successfully
rejected - promise has failed

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future. So the program can keep running when the promise is getting figured out.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

'.then()' returns a successful promise that is fulfilled. '.catch()' returns a rejected promise that has failed. These are the parameters we set on a promise / function, and it will do one of the two when it comes back.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
It's funny how you can do something twice and it seems like a near carbon copy of the successful first, and the second time it doesn't work, with coding. I want to train my eyes to notice things that don't match (like capitalization, or Id's or banana words not matching). // I will update this tomorrow; I'm still working on the project right now.
