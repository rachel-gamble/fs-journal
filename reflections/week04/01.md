> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

One sign is that your code is really long, and has a ton of curly brackets by the end.
One cause is when people write their JavaScript expecting it to execute visually from top to bottom. JavaScript doesn't work like that, but some other languages do.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous, or "async" are callbacks that take some time, or happens in the future, not right now. 
Some examples are downloading things, reading files, or talking to databases.

// Tuesday: Asynchronous code I now understand is code that doesn't have to happen in a linear patter, like A, B, C. That's synchronous code. Asynchronous code can run multiple functions at the same time, or in different orders; like C, A, C + B. They allow applications to run without pausing - while waiting for another function to occur, such as a database, or download. //

The "callback" occurs because since the program would pause to run the function, you store the code that should run after the download is complete in a function. In the download example, the function "downloadPhoto" will "call you back" or run the callback when the download is complete; and pass the downloaded photo, or an error messages if something went wrong.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Keep your code shallow. Name your functions, move them to the top.

Modularize. "Write small modules that each do one thing, and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing. You can't get into callback hell if you don't go there." - Isaac Shlueter

Handle every single error.  (note to self: try running '$standard' without the '' in my code folder supposedly it will show me every callback with an unhandled error)

Don't nest functions.
