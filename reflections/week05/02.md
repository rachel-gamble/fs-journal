## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One-toOne(1:1)
One-To-Many(1:N)
Many-To-Many(N:M)

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

For small relationship or one where each name/topic has an address/detail - it's useful to pull up all the information at once. Say it's a phone app; when looking up a person's name it's convenient to have their phone number pull up with it.
However, if the array grows larger than the minimum document size (16 MB) then we run into a problem with the embedding method; including slowing the process down and lowering performance.

Additional comments do not grow the original document, thus less likely to reach the max document size.


3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Figuring out if the topics are even or uneven. (ex: 2000 films in a category, a director with 2 films = uneven)
