## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

It's like time blocking (the term I know). Basically;

you get a task
you put it in your calender
you set a box of time to complete the task
you can only work on that task during the timebox, and if you
don't finish; that's too bad, you have to move on to your next timebox.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
Apply the two-minute rule. I kind of follow a similar one but it's 5 minutes. I bet telling myself, "this will only take 2 minutes" will make me more likely to do it, I mean come on, it'll only take two minutes. (I like the Japanese 1-minute one too; but 60 seconds isn't a lot)

Strategic quitting - something I need tbh. I'll try to get better at noticing when I'm doing something that isn't high-priority, and stopping - so that I can move onto something that is.

Prioritize: I'm always more productive when I actively journal everyday, and plan out my month/week/day. Checking in every morning/night and making a list, ect. I will pick 3 things to focus on, write them out, and make sure I at least attempt to complete them. Usually you can, but sometimes life does get in the way.

I want to do the "golden hour" but I feel like mine is between 7pm-11pm and I usually eat dinner with my boyfriend, and that's the only time of day with this schedule that I can spend any time with him and complete adulting stuff; ya know, like laundry and the other thousand things we need to do.



3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

Thanksgiving break, I definitely coded everyday, but I should have been more hard on times for certain things. It would have kept me from starting on homework late a day or two, and timeboxing could have got me working on a new part of my project rather than spending 7 hours straight on something I coudln't get right. Coming back to it the next day may have made a big difference.
