## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

Allows you to pass information to and from a website by adding or "appending" that information to the end of a URL. That information is stored in the query string and is captured by the website, when it reads the URL.
Data is passed into a request, and can be captured in node. Can be used for a variety of things such as a filter and adding additional context to a request.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query string comes after the '?' question mark in a URL.
key=value - this pair is a query parameter. With multiple, they are separated by a '&' sign.

ex:   ' ?a=1b=2 '

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

When there are multiple functions or objects a user might want to look up. For instance, looking for a specific clothing item in a specific color or style; maybe you would use query strings for that. like:
'?dress=blue'
