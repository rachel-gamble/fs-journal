## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

A sub route, or child route, inside of a parent route.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

If I wanted to make a custom modal I could use a nested route to direct the client to that component.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Maybe, I don't know. Perhaps with IDs but there wasn't anything in our reading that specific.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Group projects can really suck. I wish we got more done, but it didn't happen and someone left early. I hope I get better with group projects. I felt like I did most of everything and then my partner dipped out. And I wanted the practice!

I guess a good take away, is the practice is so so important.
