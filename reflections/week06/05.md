# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I like front end.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
Vue is way harder than I anticipated. I felt confident until we got the checkpoint.
- What are you struggling with?
Params aren't complicated, but they always error in my application. Not console, they show up there. It makes no sense.
- What would you count as a victory?
My checkpoint turned out so freaking cute!!! It was super difficult, I spent 12 hour days. haven't had a day off in weeks. But idk... It at least cute. I'm proud of that idk. Kawaii.
