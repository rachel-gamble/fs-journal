## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum is a set of named values. They're usually used as a set of predefined options for a variable. An example is a drop down menu with the days of the week listed; each day of the week could be chosen, but the choice is restricted to those listed names.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You "can" modify an Enum from the programer's perspective, but it's not advisable. It can lead to bugs and glitches occurring. Once Enums are set, it's best to leave them as is. Adding new Enums is easier than modifying pre-existing values or classes.
It cannot be reassigned after being instantiated.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

Yes! I used them in Tower for choosing what TYPE of event a user was creating (there were about 5 choices to make). I've also used them in several other instances, and will probably in AllSpice as well.
