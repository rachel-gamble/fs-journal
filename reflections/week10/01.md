## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value Type - A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.
Reference Type - A reference type doesnâ€™t store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. 
Pointer Type - Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object. Also, boxing and unboxing do not support pointers. However, you can convert between different pointer types and between pointer types and integral types.
ex:

type* identifier;
void* identifier; //allowed but not recommended

The type specified before the * in a pointer type is called the referent type. Only an unmanaged type can be a referent type.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool
byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint
ulong
ushort

They seem a lot more simple to type out to me (most of them are 4-5 characters). There seems to be more types, too. (I feel like we used like... 5 data types in JavaScript).

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

The Reference type gets stored as an address to the variable's position. It doesn't actually save the variable like in Value types.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I learned to set up my VSCode with the Model > Controller > Service > Repository
Also, the namespace MUST match the file name, strictly. 
Small things, but I learned that from debugging today. lol
