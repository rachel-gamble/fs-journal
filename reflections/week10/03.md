## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Information in a column gives the title or type of content within the table, while information in the row is the details assigned to that particular object/data/id.

For example, in the CHORE table:
columns list the type of data stored for each entry such as TASK, DURATION, and COMPLETED.
rows list the data stored for each of those data topics, such as SWEEPING under TASK, 20 MINUTES under duration, and FALSE under COMPLETED.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
    id int NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(75) NOT NULL,
    age int NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name; - This command is deleting an entry or row inside of the table; such as "Sweep" from the Chores table.
DROP TABLE table_name; - This command is deleting the entire table by that table name, such as the Chores table.
```

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

SQL is really cool and easy to manipulate! I still need to learn all the commands and hopefully memorize them one day, but there are so many ways to manipulate the data from within VSCode which is super cool. I learned you can even rename tables and rows from the commands.
