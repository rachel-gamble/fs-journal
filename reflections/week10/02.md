## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

List is a generic type, so you can create list of any type; such as a User/Customer or a value type such as 'int'). It allows you to store a collection of items and provides various methods for manipulating the items, such as adding, removing, and searching for items. Lists are dynamic, meaning that the number of items in the list can grow or shrink as items are added or removed. Lists are implemented as an array and provide an efficient way to work with many items.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

new List - because it creates a new list
List.Add - to add objects/variables/ect. to the list
List.Clear - to remove all the messed up objects in a list; maybe to start over or fix the model.
List.Find - to find specific item
List.FindLast - it's the last one you made; likely.
List.FindAll Could be checking if it got created, or want to move it, or draw what you just made.
List.Remove - to remove from the list
List.Insert

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

int firstItem = myList[0];

List.Find - this is likely the method you would use to retrieve an item from a list.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I'm still confused on how to use the new languages and probably will be for awhile; but from using it yesterday I really liked it! It makes sense; I just don't know all the code yet. But I think I'll enjoy it.
