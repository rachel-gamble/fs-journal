## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

A parameter is the NAME created in the function definition.
An argument is the VALUE the function receives from each parameter, when the function is invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function, it's called a "higher-order function". 

An example given is Array.prototype.map

I will try to come up with my own as I get more comfortable with JaveScript this week.
