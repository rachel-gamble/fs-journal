## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is where the variables are available for use.
Var declarations are globally scoped when declared outside a function.
let and const are block scoped, bound by {curly braces} code block.

2. What is Hoisting ? Hoisting in JavaScript is a mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Use LET when you know that the value of a variable will change.
Const should be used most of the time. You can't change a const variable to another value, so it keeps the integrity of the value/variable, but not be used if you're going to change it. The const variable can only be used within the first block of code you wrote with it.
var is not that useful anymore, some of the websites I read suggested you basically don't use it at all. Var can be used outside of a block, and can deal with global scope or function. Var will let you change the variable without throwing an error signal.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment: JavaScript is difficult! lol I feel so lost. I should probably ask for tutoring.
