## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
Oh man! Making a plan before coding is so helpful. Some benefits include knowing the structure of the site/app you're building, seeing if what is important is standing out, and not wasting your time.
Helps with CodeQuality; avoids waterfall effect.
Gives you the patience to make very clear code.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Google first (lol). Throwing random code at it. My notes. Crying. (jk) More google searches. Desperate reddit hunt. Desperate and usually unhelpful youtube search. Asking for help. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
The idea of simplifying your code. Sometimes it's better to take some out, then add more. New developers can be quick to just start coding right out the gate without pre-planning what they are building; and they (me lol) quickly just start throwing code at it. Being concise and using the simplest methods possible are better.
