Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment:
HOLY CRAP today was soooo hard, but I finally got the very basic minimal functions working. My cart works, the total works, and the buy button clears the total. However, I only got one line of ice creams on the screen, and had to comment out the cones and topping for now.

I guess what I take from that, is to start small. I tried putting all of the objects into arrays first and get some <div> boxes looking pretty, but I should have just focused on getting the buttons on the screen, and making them work before adding more arrays and more styling. idk. I'm proud that I stayed late and got any of it to work at all. And it's pretty seamless too... for the 4 buttons that work. lol
