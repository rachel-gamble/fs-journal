## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log("your message or function here") - it's a GREAT way to see if your code and functions are working, and if JavaScript is linked in your HTML. I honestly don't get the other half of this question... you can right-click "inspect" to pull up the console view on a site.
Ummm.... the other way would be to invoke functions within the console, which is helpful to see if they are working. The console is great for seeing if code is broken, and what HTML and CSS is doing.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The 'Elements' tab along with the selector tool allows you to see the exact breakdown of each HTML/CSS code by section, div box, button, ect. It shows you exactly what code is affecting what object. It's useful with debugging because you can see which code is working, and also see which code isn't working - and the elements tab will show you exactly what line in your code is affecting the object you select.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

There is a "debug" function that you can add to your code and it will help you through that.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment:
HOLY CRAP today was soooo hard, but I finally got the very basic minimal functions working. My cart works, the total works, and the buy button clears the total. However, I only got one line of ice creams on the screen, and had to comment out the cones and topping for now.

I guess what I take from that, is to start small. I tried putting all of the objects into arrays first and get some <div> boxes looking pretty, but I should have just focused on getting the buttons on the screen, and making them work before adding more arrays and more styling. idk. I'm proud that I stayed late and got any of it to work at all. And it's pretty seamless too... for the 4 buttons that work. lol
