## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is just like it sounds; documenting your code. It's is extremely useful though; not only for teaching others, but for reading code you wrote a month+ ago.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

You can teach your friends! People working on the code you wrote late have some idea what the code is doing. It's super helpful for yourself if you step away from a project for a week and come back, and aren't sure what's going on.
Personally, I've also found it helpful for identifying areas of my code. Like say my Home Page code is starting to get really long. It's really helpful for me to have notes telling me where the navigation buttons are, or the comment section ect. I can quickly find the one link section I'm working on without reading through 200 lines of <template>.
It's been nice having commented out code in my projects for stuff that doesn't work, and leaving a note on why it didn't work so that I learn.

Knowing what something does in necessary.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

I think it's really important, but I'm also a note taker.. While writing code for The Network and Tower I started to write notes all over the place for myself. In parts of Tower like the Home Page and Event Page, I left myself notes for each section on the page. Both before I mapped them out and after. It helped me find what I was working on quickly.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

From lab today, I really learned that writing code takes forever. Average people who don't code have no idea how difficult and how much time it took for programmers to make their favorite websites and apps. I look at everything differently now. 

It was cool seeing Mick and Jeremy switch with front and back end, that must be a really nice workflow vs all the pressure on yourself.
