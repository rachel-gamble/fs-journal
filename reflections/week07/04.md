## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We didn't have a partner project this week, it was us working solo on Tower. 
I used props a lot this week. I'm still confused on how they work exactly. 

2. What went well this week?
Well, I learned a LOT. haha A couple times I needed help debugging something in my code and I learned a lot from it. Probably more than when my code worked.


3. What would you do differently?
Watch the Vue videos! I haven't found time to yet. Although on the flip side, I know that watching them after "gaunlet week" will help solidify everything I have learned. If I watched them earlier I wouldn't have really known what they were talking about, but this week when I do, they will reinforce everything; maybe answer questions I have. I'm looking forward to it this week / Christmas break and super studying. I also wish that I had stayed for the very last FireSide. I would do that differently.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I have so much to learn. I feel really overwhelmed. My eyes hurt more than they've ever hurt. I feel like I am trash. I need to remember I'm a baby coder and it just takes time. I really need to make time to work out to balance the 12 hour days doing all brain work. This week has been brutal. I still like it though, I do genuinely like coding.
