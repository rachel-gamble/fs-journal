## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

I loved today's reading. User Experience is how the customer or client feels interacting with your web/app/business.
When we develop front end websites(apps, ect) we should consider why the user is coming to your app. What actions they want to take. How you want them to feel during each action and when they leave. How intuitive the steps are; and making it as easy as 5 steps or less.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

Returning customers, for one. Making people feels good. Brand loyalty. Word of mouth.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

It's literally the point of a website being built. I know I know, you're thinking, "No Rachel! The point of making this website is so that people can buy things." Well, yes, it's for your business. But the user experience ultimately determines how successful that business is. If you have a good product but your UX is slow, clumsy, or trash; people are likely going to look for alternatives. If the UX is easy, communicates the personality you want to project, and leaves the user feeling good about it; they won't just come back - they'll bring their friends.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Oh god, I wish I wasn't moving this week / weekend!!! I need like, 30 hours in a day to work on this project. lol My house is falling apart. My back hurts. Dang. All I do all day everyday is code. lol It's ok, I totally get why we're doing this. It's just crazy. I wish I was better at coding than I am. When I get through this week, I really want to read more coding books. Idk. Probably just coding more will help too. I just really want to be good at this and I feel so crappy and unprepared. I stay at school until they kick me out like everynight. lol and then go code more at home. My social life is 100% dead. I don't know if this is a take away or what, I'm so tired. I guess my takeaway today is, I just wish I was better and that sucks. I hope I do get better one day, but I know it's a lifetime thing.
