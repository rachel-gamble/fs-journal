## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when two programmers use a single workstation, or mouse, keyboard, and screen. one drives and the other directs or navigates. They switch positions occasionally.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

You get the knowledge of two people! One programer might struggle with forms while the other is a master of them, for an example. There is a greater chance between the two to notice errors, and write better code.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

If the two programmers don't get along or one has bad hygiene, the two could not work well together; or at all. It is slightly more expensive; but usually that will be regained through the amazing code they write.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

We didn't really have a solid assignment today, because we're preparing for our next checkpoint and had lecture and grading most of the day. I love our lecture time though, I learn so much from it. Watching a site be made in front of us by Mick/Jeremy/Sam ect is a privilege. I took hundreds of lines of notes today on Vue and how it works.
