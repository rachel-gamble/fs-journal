# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Our group met up three times over break and we got a lot done. Back end done. APIs. Pages made. Our cool navbar offcanvas is mostly functioning now. 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
How hard getting a weather API to work was. 

- What are you struggling with?
Javascript is still the most difficult for me to work in.

- What would you count as a victory?

That our group met up in person three times over break. I think that shows our commitment to learn and succeed.
