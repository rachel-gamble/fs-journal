## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing allows you to test individual units of code in isolation. It provides confidence in the code. From my experience, it feels really good to know for sure that a back end test works, for example. You can set it in metaphorical stone (for now) and move on; knowing tha the base of your code is solid.

Component Testing to test Vue components.

End to End Testing tests the end user's experience, so both front and back end.


2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I don't think any of them  are most important. They're building blocks of each other. Starting with unit testing though.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
I don't think any of those testing methods are the least useful. I think you need to test all of them for a good project to work.

I learned how to build a timer. It looks awful for now though. Need to style it. Front end isn't "easier".
