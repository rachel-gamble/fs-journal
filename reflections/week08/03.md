## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

Testing small units of code at a time to see if they work. It evaluates a software application or system to deem if it meets specified requirements and works as expected.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

It provides peace of mind, confidence, efficiency, documentation, and better design. Knowing that some of your code works gives peace of mind and confidence to continue on, it provides efficiency because you're not building on broken code, documentation helps engineers know what's going on in the code when the code itself is not clear, and all of this together with small unit testing allows and provides better design.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

The first potential drawback one would think of is of course time and cost. Some other possible drawbacks include limited coverage (it's not possible to test ALL possible scenarios and combinations, unfortunately), maintenance, false positives and negatives, and dependency on testing.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

I think we felt a tad overwhelmed today. Though the scope of our project may seen smallish, the visualization of writing out calenders and habit trackers - are both components we have never coded before. I have hope though. I know that if we study really hard we will figure it out. The cool thing about working in a group, is everyone is going to come up with unique phrasing and their algorithms are going to be difference when searching for resources and training.
