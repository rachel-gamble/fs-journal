## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

So much! It helps us get jobs, yay! Whether those are freelance or through a cooperation.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Quality is number one. Having 5-6 strong pieces is best. Aiming your portfolio for a particular job / goal is a good aim to have. As well as demonstrating 3-4 sills you excel in.


3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

Plant Clicker! If I fixed a couple things and made it mobile friendly; because it's cute as heck. I LOVE how aesthetic it turned out.

The Network maybe if I cleaned up some of the functionality; again, because it turned out really good looking aesthetically.

Definitely our Glimmer (Inspire inspired) Capstone that we just started; because it's going to be freaking awesome! And it's mobile first; so that's a good variety piece. I can't wait to build more sites!
I hope to have 6+ in my portfolio before job searching. Dang; I need to re-vist some of my sites!

Should probably work on Tower this Christmas break too; and make that look better.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
I need to start working on my portfolio; even though I'm not ready, so that I do have something built at graduation.

I'm so excited!

In our 1st Capstone day; I learned how to build a mid-level figma!!! I'm sooo excited about it, yay! Finally. I loved all the work we did today in our group. I learned a lot about what working in a real business situation is like. We were all very professional and did a great job preparing for our pitch tomorrow. I'm really proud of us.

Also learned, that Mick was right; having a group that is all genuinely interested in a project goes all the way. I'm so grateful for our app,  and for how inspired we are as a group to bring it to life.
