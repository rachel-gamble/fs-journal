## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Everything we do affects each other and our project. It helps us all feel heard, to include everyone and pick ideas, and of course, avoid merge conflicts!

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Members must stay focused on results. Results-oriented mindset helps the team "take up the slack" and share additional responsibilities, rather than asking the unhelpful, "How are we going to do this with fewer people?"

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
The Unattainable Triangle voices tradeoffs in the paradox between speed,  quality and cost of development.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

We had to start our project over because our team size changed. This actually changed our scope, priorities, and even app name. A takeaway from that I guess, is that we need to be flexible to change and outside circumstances. And not to hold too tightly to a dream. (sounds sad lol)
