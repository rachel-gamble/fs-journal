## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate your software development workflows; it's a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.

It lets you create workflows that build and test every pull request to one's repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

Create text files; these are workflows.
Workflows handle common build tasks, like continuous delivery and continuous integration.
(ex actions: can compress images, test code, and push the site to your hosting platform when the master branch changes.)
Tasks can run on specific timeframes, or control what happens when somebody interacts with the GitHub repository. (ex: running an action when somebody starts your project)


2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

It automates everything in the GitHub flow. You can implement powerful automations right in your repositories, create your own actions or use readily available actions on the GitHub Marketplace to integrate your prefferred tools right into your repository.

You can run code tests in various platforms like Linus, macOS and Windows.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

Workflow
Scheduled
Webhooks
External

These workflow events manage the triggering of the actions. Something like a push, a pull request, or a fork that refers to changes in the repository.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

I have so much more to learn about making a web app from scratch! The deploying is all something new to me. 

Working with code that your group isn't familiar with can be detrimental to the group as a whole, as only one person understands it.
