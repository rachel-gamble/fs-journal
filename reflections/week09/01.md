## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using several API's in our project. Currently active we have a background image from UnSplash, a weather API, one for inspirational quotes, dad jokes, and almost done with a poetry option as well. 
We are also exploring calendars, but they have proven to be the most challenging technology we've worked with yet. 

2. What went well so far?

Our group met up three times over break. That was awesome. We also work pretty ok as a team.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I would reply to Slack more often over break; mostly to make Kayla happy. I'd also study more over break. I just moved into a house though so that's my excuse. haha I did finish the Bootstrap videos too, though.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Again and again I learn that things I think will be simple can end up taking the whole or half of a day! I also learned a lot about drop downs, and that APIs can get really complicated. Most of ours worked pretty smoothly (weather was a challenge) but the poetry one keeps eluding us.
