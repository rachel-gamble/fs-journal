1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is an encoding schema used for representing binary data in a text formate. It's helpful when storage or delivery mediums do not support binary data, such as embedding an image ito a database, CSS files, or HTML. 

(Warning: do not mix up compression with encoding // encoding defines how data is encoded vs compression actually compresses data)

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Base64 will on average increase the file size more than 25% (oh no!). - Which increases your bandwidth bill and the download time.

Modern HTTP requests can send large amounts of data at a time, so increasing the size of an image by 25% is not in anyone's best interest. Modern day, that could slow down the system.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Today was a good styling day for me; it made me really happy.
