## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

Small data files that cryptographically establish encrypted links between the web server and a browser.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate - This certificate shows the padlock, HTTPS, business name, and business country in the address bar to diminish being mistaken for a spam website.
The most extensive. A priority for those that need identity assurance.

Organization Validated (OV SSL) Certificate - verifies that your organization and domain validation are real.

Domain Validation (DV) Certificate - Offers low level encryption shown as a green padlock next to a URL address bar.
It's the fastest validation you can receive.

Wildcard SSL Certificates - Wildcard SSLs ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use that same certificate for subdomains.
In the ‚Äúdomain and subdomain number‚Äù category.

Unified Communications (UCC) SSL Certificate - Allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. UCCs were created to bridge communication between a single server and browser but have since expanded to include multiple domain names by the same owner.

Single Domain SSL Certificate - A Single Domain SSL protects one domain. 


3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

Proof that data is secure.
