## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I'm concerned about the job market following graduation, just from what people are saying about the economy ect. 
I plan to pretty much work on the project most of my time. I will take breaks if I get stuck, and switch to something different if needed. I've enjoyed the community and learning how to code. Being able to read code, by itself, has been very rewarding.
