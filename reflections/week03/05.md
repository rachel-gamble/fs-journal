# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? 

Our fruit-salad webpage turned out really pretty. The design made it look so good. I got the duck with my game plant-farmer on Monday. I also bought a new design book that I'm super excited about. I love it already.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise? 

MVC is SO hard! I felt somewhat confident after checkpoint #2, and now I am so lost.

- What are you struggling with? 

Definitely making everything in MVC work and talk to eachother.. I'm struggling with drawing new components onto the page. It bums me out so bad. I wish I could simply look up the problem or have a coding bible on hand that would help me make this work, but everything I've used as a resource hasn't helped me solve this problem. I've been working for long hours 3 days in a row to make that one function work, and I can't get it. Hopefully I do before midnight tonight. 


- What would you count as a victory? Getting my note app to save the note and name. That made me really happy. I don't know... I'd consider my dedication a victory, even if it's not enough.
