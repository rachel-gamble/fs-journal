## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
It helps when user input data is projected into one or many components. It helps keep the design and code reusable and easier to read. (aka clean and effective)

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

Subscribe, unsubscribe, broadcast.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

It helps when your app starts getting realllly big, so you don't have to reiterate code over and over again that can be simplified, and used for more than one model. I helps monitor.
