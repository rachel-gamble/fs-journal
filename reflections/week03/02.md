It can help prevent bugs from shared mutable state. It's a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannon access the state values for all of the variables of a particular object.
It hides both data members and functions or meathods;
helps keep data safe.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Underscore prefixes complicate things because users don't know they aren't supposed to use it. It could make things less safe, so expanded attack surface for hackers with public APIs especially. Breaking changes. Self Documenting Code.
