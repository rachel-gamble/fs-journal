## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
if 
else
return
console.log

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

"The default implementation of the get operator is to return the value stored in that key in the Object. Since we overrode it to just log a statement, the value is never returned, and hence the console.log() statement on line14 logs undefined."

Make sure you use the right capitalization or not, or plural or singular!

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
Gives some custom logic.
I don't know, this is all a bit over my head. I think after some time to think about it I will get it more.
