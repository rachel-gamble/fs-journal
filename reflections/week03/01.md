## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

Everything has to be *very* particular with names, like Name and name - not the same. You also have to import it into the other files.

2. How does export differ from export default?

By default, every declaration in that file stays local to that module and cannot be accessed in other modules unless the module file exports them.

With ES6 modules, you can concatenate all scripts in one main script by marking some of them as exports, then other modules can import them.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Code can be split into small files of self-contained functionality. Debugging is easier. Helps with eradicating naming conflicts.

I am in way over my head! Honestly my take away today, is that I have to be ok with not understanding for now, and know that I will eventually. I'm dedicated; remind myself of why I'm here and that I can do this.
