# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Inheritance enables code reuse. It's a mechanims in object oriented programming that allows a child class to be base on an existing parent class (or subclass and baseclass/superclass).
The child class inherits properties and methods from the parent class - which can reuse, extend, or override those properties and methods.
It's like a "Car" class a parent and "Ford Explorer" as the child class.

```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Singleton design pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
Singleton pattern is mostly used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections.

```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state. The Observer pattern provides a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to and from these events for any object that implements a subscriber interface.
An object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any changes to its state. The observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects, where one object changes and many other objects are notified and updated automatically.

The pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes its state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Factory Method design pattern is a software design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A method of implementing software programming that interlaces unit testing, programming and refactoring on source code.

```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
DoD is the Definition of Done. It defines what is constituted as "done" in a project. This definition is understood by the team, and can include things such as functional requirements, performance standards, and acceptance criteria. 

```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer. The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.

Two examples are:

As a user, I  want to be able to set reminders for events so that I don't forget them.

As a customer I want to be able to quickly search for products on the website so that I can easily find and buy what I'm looking for.

```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
During a Sprint, the Sprint Backlog is created during the Sprint Planning ceremony.


```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Tasks are typically assigned to team members during the Sprint Planning ceremony.
