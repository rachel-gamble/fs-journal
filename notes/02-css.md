# CSS

the S in the SOLID principles - Single Responsibility. Our index.html is responsible for content and our style.css is responsible for how that content is presented. Our code is now easier to read and maintain resulting in quicker debugging and less bugs overall.
Selectors are how you pick which element to apply styles to.
